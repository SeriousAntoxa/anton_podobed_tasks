4) Currying functions: multiply all elements in an array
To complete this Kata you need to make a function multiplyAll/multiply_all 
which takes an array of integers as an argument. This function must return another function, 
which takes a single integer as an argument and returns a new array.

The returned array should consist of each of the elements from the first array multiplied by the integer.

Example:
multiplyAll([1, 2, 3])(2) = [2, 4, 6];

You must not mutate the original array.



solution
let multiplyAll = arr => x => arr.map(item => item * x);

multiplyAll([1, 2, 3])(2)
